Nice to meet you here! Hope to be friends with you.

My name is Shuai MAO. I'm currently a third-year graduate student at [Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University](http://eie.xjtu.edu.cn/en/index.htm), on track to graduate in the summer of 2024. I previously obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021. During my sophomore year, I decided to broaden my cultural horizons and expand my social network. Consequently, I enrolled in a double degree program, which took me to [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) from 2019 to 2021. Curriculum at CentraleSup√©lec emphasized the fusion of theory and practice. While studying the course, I developed an intense passion for mathematics. This newfound interest served as the catalyst for me to seize the opportunity to advance my studies in mathematics at University of Paris XI. To accommodate this additional academic pursuit, I carefully managed my time, attending regular classes during the day and dedicating my evenings to mastering mathematics. My persistence and hard work ultimately paid off when I achieved high scores in my CentraleSup√©lec courses and successfully passed the challenging mathematics examinations. Although this period was undeniably demanding, it brought me immense satisfaction and joy in the pursuit of my academic goals.

My current research centers around ghost imaging, which is also referred to as quantum imaging or correlated imaging. Unlike traditional first-order-based imaging algorithms, this innovative imaging technique relies on second-order correlations within the light field, specifically the fluctuations in intensity. While it offers advantages such as being lensless, robust against disturbances, and non-localized in nature, the current approach demands a substantial number of measurements, thus restricting its practical utility. My research efforts are primarily directed toward optimizing ghost imaging algorithms. Throughout this research journey, I have not only developed a profound understanding of ghost imaging but have also acquired knowledge in areas such as image processing, compressed sensing, optimization techniques, inverse problems, and deep learning. Among these, deep learning has emerged as my most powerful tool in advancing the field. On one hand, I am astounded by its remarkable effectiveness. On the other hand, I also recognize the importance of enhancing our comprehension of the fundamental nature of deep learning to ensure that its power does not inadvertently harm people.

I am currently eagerly anticipating opportunities for PhD positions in 2024, particularly in the fields of image processing, computer vision, Explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI. If you want to find more information about me, you can find my [CV](../files/MAO SHUAI.pdf) here.
