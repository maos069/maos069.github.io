Nice to meet you here! Hope to be friends with you.

My name is Shuai MAO. I'm currently a third-year graduate student at [Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University](http://eie.xjtu.edu.cn/en/index.htm), on track to graduate in the summer of 2024. I previously obtained my bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021. During my sophomore year, I decided to broaden my cultural horizons and expand my social network. Consequently, I enrolled in a double degree program, which took me to [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) from 2019 to 2021. Curriculum at CentraleSup√©lec emphasized the fusion of theory and practice. While studying the course, I developed an intense passion for mathematics. This newfound interest served as the catalyst for me to seize the opportunity to advance my studies in mathematics at University of Paris XI. To accommodate this additional academic pursuit, I carefully managed my time, attending regular classes during the day and dedicating my evenings to mastering mathematics. My persistence and hard work ultimately paid off when I achieved high scores in my CentraleSup√©lec courses and successfully passed the challenging mathematics examinations. Although this period was undeniably demanding, it brought me immense satisfaction and joy in the pursuit of my academic goals.

My current research centers around ghost imaging, which is also referred to as quantum imaging or correlated imaging. Unlike traditional first-order-based imaging algorithms, this innovative imaging technique relies on second-order correlations within the light field, specifically the fluctuations in intensity. While it offers advantages such as being lensless, robust against disturbances, and non-localized in nature, the current approach demands a substantial number of measurements, thus restricting its practical utility. My research efforts are primarily directed toward optimizing ghost imaging algorithms. Throughout this research journey, I have not only developed a profound understanding of ghost imaging but have also acquired knowledge in areas such as image processing, compressed sensing, optimization techniques, inverse problems, and deep learning. Among these, deep learning has emerged as my most powerful tool in advancing the field. On one hand, I am astounded by its remarkable effectiveness. On the other hand, I also recognize the importance of enhancing our comprehension of the fundamental nature of deep learning to ensure that its power does not inadvertently harm people.

I am currently eagerly anticipating opportunities for PhD positions in 2024, particularly in the fields of image processing, computer vision, Explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI. If you want to find more information about me, you can find my [CV](../files/MAO SHUAI.pdf) here.

# üíª Internships
## *2023.06 - 2023.09*, Backend Developper Summer Intern, [Mei Tuan](https://www.meituan.com/en-US/about-us), China.

During my internship as a Java Developer at Meituan, I played a pivotal role in driving the growth and innovation of the back-end business while concurrently contributing to network security enhancement. Here's an overview of my key responsibilities and accomplishments:

1. Interface Risk Assessment: I spearheaded the development of an interface risk assessment system aimed at evaluating network interface vulnerability to crawler attacks. This initiative involved several key achievements: conducting comprehensive curve similarity analysis to identify recurring traffic patterns, adopting the Pearson correlation as the core of our security assessment model, establishing a seamless online-to-offline data integration process for daily risk calculations, and scaling the system to assess the security of over 2,000 interfaces, effectively reducing the risk of malicious web crawler attacks.

2. JSON Parsing and Performance Analysis: I delved deeply into the realm of JSON parsing techniques and harnessed the potent capabilities of Java Microbenchmarking Harness (JMH) for conducting comprehensive performance analyses. Through testing, we meticulously evaluated the parsing speed across various methods for JSON strings of differing sizes and nesting levels. This exploration not only broadened our comprehension of efficient data processing but also yielded invaluable insights crucial for optimizing our systems to attain peak performance.

3. Store hot list evaluationÔºöTo bolster our system's promotion capabilities, I crafted RPC and HTTP interfaces for hot list evaluation. I leveraged CompletableFuture for asynchronous processing of Excel data streams, facilitating the evaluation of nearly 20,000 stores efficiently. Concurrently, I introduced a secondary category field, completed the transformation of response interfaces and databases, and enabled precise store classification.

## *2022.07 - 2023.08*, Hardware Reliability Intern, [Amazon China](https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services), China.

During my internship at Amazon, I had the chance to dive into the important world of hardware reliability. This field is all about making sure products are not only well-designed but also safe and long-lasting for users.

My internship started with research on common low-power chargers available in the market. To get a better grasp of what's out there, I analyzed twelve chargers from four well-known brands. My main aim was to carefully assess how reliable these chargers were. This included investigating their ultrasonic welding methods, their thickness, efforts to make them more compact, their handling of electrical aspects like capacitance, and their safety features such as fuses.

In my role, I actively promoted teamwork within the group. I shared my research findings with my colleagues, and together, we collaborated on various projects to make improvements. Armed with the knowledge I gained, we enhanced our products to ensure they not only perform well but are also safe for users. This played a pivotal role in helping Amazon maintain its competitive edge in the market, all while putting user satisfaction and safety first.

When I look back on my time at Amazon, I take immense pride in being part of a company that places such a strong emphasis on creating reliable and safe products. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of designing products that are user-friendly and safe for everyone. It continues to motivate me to use my skills to be accountable to users and ensure their safety.
